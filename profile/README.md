## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Strategy with Turborepo
To streamline development and ensure consistency, **Authism** services are developed within **monorepos**, managed by **Turborepo**. This approach allows for:
- **Atomic Commits:** Changes across multiple services (e.g., an API and its consumer) are made in a single, traceable commit.
- **Simplified Dependency Management:** Shared libraries and types are easily managed across the entire application.
- **Optimized CI/CD:** Turborepo intelligently determines which services are affected by a change, ensuring that only the necessary code is built, tested, and deployed.

### Rust-First Philosophy
As a green firm, Authism prioritizes **Rust for all backend services** to ensure memory safety, performance, and modern development practices. The microservice architecture within our monorepo provides the flexibility to onboard developers with different skill levels while maintaining our Rust-centric approach.

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js with React (Multi-platform support)
- **Testing**: Jest for comprehensive test coverage
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker, served via Nginx
- **Build Tool**: Next.js's integrated build system, orchestrated by Turborepo

### Backend Microservices
**Rust-first approach with strategic flexibility:**

- **Authentication Service** (`authix`): Rust + Actix Web
  - OAuth integration, JWT token management
  - Argon2 password hashing for security
- **User Management**: Rust + Actix Web
  - Profile management, CV handling
  - Project showcases, announcements
- **Job Listings**: Rust + Actix Web
  - Company data management
  - Job posting and search functionality
- **Social Features**: Rust + Actix Web *(Future)*
  - Developer discovery and matching
  - Tech interest networking

*Note: TypeScript with Bun is our secondary choice for services requiring rapid development or when team expertise requires it. Other alternatives (Python/FastAPI, Go/Gin, Java/Spring) available as needed.*

### Data & Communication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary data store)
- **Caching**: Redis for session and query caching
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous service communication
- **Service Communication**: gRPC for internal APIs
- **External APIs**: RESTful endpoints for client integration

---

## üöÄ Infrastructure & DevOps

### Self-Hosted Philosophy
Authism maintains full control over critical infrastructure with minimal external dependencies:

**Self-Hosted Components:**
- Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration
- PostgreSQL and Redis databases
- All microservices and APIs
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure

**External Services (Limited):**
- **Cloudflare**: Edge delivery, DNS, and security
- **Cloudflare R2**: Object storage for files and media

### Deployment Pipeline
- **Containerization**: Docker for all services
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with custom manifests
- **Build System**: **Turborepo** for high-performance, incremental builds and dependency management.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing. Workflows are optimized by Turborepo to only run jobs on affected services.
- **Monitoring**: Planned (Prometheus/Grafana stack)
- **Networking**: Nginx ingress with Cloudflare Tunnels

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Agile with Scrum in a Monorepo
- Sprint-based development cycles.
- The monorepo structure facilitates seamless cross-functional collaboration between frontend, backend, and DevOps teams.
- Regular retrospectives and planning sessions.

### Standardized Commit Messages
To maintain a clear, understandable, and automated Git history, we adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This structured format enables automatic versioning and changelog generation. All commits should follow this standard. The commits that do not follow this are to be rejected and shall be reworded.

**Commit Message TL;DR:**

- **Format:** `type(scope): subject`
- **Common Types:**
  - `feat`: A new feature for the end-user.
  - `fix`: A bug fix for the end-user.
  - `docs`: Documentation changes only.
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc; no production code change).
  - `refactor`: Refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable.
  - `test`: Adding/updating tests; no production code change.
  - `chore`: Updating dependencies, build configs, etc; no production code change.
- **Breaking Changes:** Use `!` after the type for breaking changes (e.g., `refactor(auth)!: ...`).

**Examples:**

```
feat: allow users to upload profile pictures
fix(api): correct pagination error on jobs endpoint
docs: update authentication service README
refactor!: rename primary key from id to user_id in users table
```

### Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing**: Jest for frontend, language-specific frameworks for backend.
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing orchestrated by Turborepo.
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting enforced across the entire monorepo.
- **Security**: Regular dependency audits and vulnerability scanning.

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a private project under the Authism organization. For internal team members:

1.  **Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for all commit messages.**
2.  Familiarize yourself with the monorepo structure and Turborepo commands.
3.  Follow the established coding standards for each language.
4.  Write comprehensive tests for new features within their respective service directories.
5.  Submit pull requests for code review; `CODEOWNERS` will automatically assign reviewers based on the code you've changed.
6.  Update documentation for any architectural changes.

---

### 4. Git Repository Performance
This is a very long-term concern, but for massive projects with millions of files and years of history, `git` operations themselves can become slow. Companies like Google and Meta have developed custom tooling to deal with this, but it's something to be aware of on a 5+ year horizon.

### Conclusion

You have made a strong, modern, and highly scalable architectural choice. By committing to Turborepo, you are acknowledging and proactively solving the primary drawback of a monorepo. The remaining challenges are well-understood in the industry and have known solutions.

Your approach is not "negative-free," but it is **"negative-aware,"** which is the hallmark of a great engineering strategy.
